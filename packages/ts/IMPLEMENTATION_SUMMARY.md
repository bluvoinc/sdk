# Bluvo SDK State Machine Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core State Machine Infrastructure
- **`createMachine.ts`** - Generic state machine factory with subscription support
- **`flowMachine.ts`** - Parent state machine orchestrating the entire withdrawal flow
- **`withdrawalMachine.ts`** - Nested state machine for handling withdrawal lifecycle

### 2. Type System
- **`machine.types.ts`** - Core machine interfaces and types
- **`flow.types.ts`** - Flow-specific states and actions
- **`withdrawal.types.ts`** - Withdrawal-specific states and actions

### 3. BluvoFlowClient
- **`BluvoFlowClient.ts`** - High-level client integrating state machines with Bluvo APIs
- Handles WebSocket subscriptions, API calls, and state synchronization
- Provides methods for all user actions (OAuth, 2FA, SMS, retries)

### 4. React Adapters
- **`useFlowMachine.ts`** - React hook for flow machine state
- **`useWithdrawMachine.ts`** - React hook for withdrawal machine state
- **`useBluvoFlow.ts`** - High-level React hook combining everything

### 5. Examples
- **`vanilla-typescript.ts`** - Pure TypeScript usage example
- **`react-component.tsx`** - Complete React component example

### 6. Tests
- **`withdrawalMachine.test.ts`** - Comprehensive withdrawal machine tests
- **`flowMachine.test.ts`** - Flow machine integration tests

## Key Features

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Framework-agnostic design
- Clean subscription API: `subscribe()`, `send()`, `getState()`, `dispose()`
- Proper cleanup and memory management

### Human-Readable States
- Clear state names: `oauth:waiting`, `quote:ready`, `withdraw:error2FA`
- States map directly to UI conditions
- Easy to understand and debug

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry with new idempotency keys
- Recoverable errors: 2FA, SMS, KYC, insufficient balance
- Terminal states: completed, blocked, fatal

### TypeScript First
- Strict typing throughout
- No external state machine libraries
- Compile-time safety for states and actions

## Usage

### Import from Main Package
```typescript
import { 
  BluvoFlowClient,
  createFlowMachine,
  createWithdrawalMachine 
} from '@bluvo/sdk-ts';
```

### Import React Hooks
```typescript
import { 
  useBluvoFlow,
  useFlowMachine,
  useWithdrawMachine 
} from '@bluvo/sdk-ts/react';
```

## Security-First Architecture

The implementation follows security best practices for browser applications:
- **No API keys in browser**: Uses callback functions instead of direct API calls
- **Server-side operations**: API keys remain secure on the server
- **Framework integration**: Works seamlessly with Next.js Server Actions, TanStack Query, etc.
- **Type safety**: Error types are preserved through callback boundaries

## Integration with Existing SDK

The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing BluvoWebClient:
- Uses the same WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
- Compatible with existing OAuth2 flow
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Server Actions call the existing BluvoClient with API keys
- Browser-safe: No sensitive credentials exposed to client-side

## Production Readiness

✅ Unit tested  
✅ TypeScript strict mode  
✅ Memory leak prevention  
✅ Error handling  
✅ Extensible architecture  
✅ Clear documentation  
✅ Minimal API surface  

The state machine implementation is ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for building reactive cryptocurrency withdrawal flows in any JavaScript framework.
