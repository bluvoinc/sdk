### 5. `BluvoFlowClient.test.ts` (28 tests)
**BluvoFlowClient Error Handling**

#### Covered Error Scenarios:
- ✅ All withdrawal error codes (insufficient balance, 2FA, SMS, KYC, etc.)
- ✅ Legacy error format handling
- ✅ Amount validation errors
- ✅ Address validation errors
- ✅ Network support errors
- ✅ Quote expiration errors
- ✅ Fatal errors
- ✅ Error code extraction edge cases
- ✅ Complex multi-error scenarios

### 6. `flowMachine.test.ts` (15 tests)
**Original FlowMachine Tests**

Basic flow machine functionality and transitions.

### 7. `withdrawalMachine.test.ts` (12 tests)
**Original WithdrawalMachine Tests**

Basic withdrawal machine functionality and transitions.

## Test Statistics

```
Total Test Files: 7
Total Tests: 199
All Passing: ✅
```

### Coverage Breakdown:
- **FlowMachine States**: 30/30 states covered (100%)
- **WithdrawalMachine States**: 9/9 states covered (100%)
- **State Transitions**: All valid transitions tested
- **Invalid Transitions**: All invalid transitions verified
- **Error Scenarios**: All error codes and types covered
- **Integration Paths**: All major user journeys covered
- **Edge Cases**: Extensive boundary and edge case coverage

## Key Testing Principles Applied

### 1. **Complete State Transition Coverage**
Every possible state transition is explicitly tested, including:
- Valid transitions
- Invalid transitions (ensuring state doesn't change)
- Terminal states (cannot transition out)

### 2. **Context Preservation**
All tests verify that context data is preserved correctly through state transitions.

### 3. **Error Handling**
Comprehensive coverage of all error types, error codes, and error recovery scenarios.

### 4. **Integration Testing**
Real-world user journeys tested end-to-end with multiple interruptions and edge cases.

### 5. **Memory Leak Prevention**
Tests ensure proper cleanup of subscribers and nested machines.

### 6. **Edge Cases**
Boundary conditions, rapid operations, concurrent actions, and unusual inputs tested.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cd packages/ts && pnpm test

# Run specific test file
cd packages/ts && pnpm test flowMachine.comprehensive

# Run with coverage
cd packages/ts && pnpm test --coverage
```

## Test Maintenance

When adding new states or transitions:

1. Add tests to `flowMachine.comprehensive.test.ts` or `withdrawalMachine.comprehensive.test.ts`
2. Add integration tests to `integration.test.ts` for complete user journeys
3. Add edge cases to `edgeCases.test.ts` if needed
4. Update error handling tests in `BluvoFlowClient.test.ts` if new error codes added
5. Update this summary document

## Notes

- All stderr output in test runs (error logging) is expected and part of normal test execution
- Tests use vi.fn() mocks for callbacks and subscriptions
- Async operations are properly awaited where needed
- Tests are isolated and can run in any order
